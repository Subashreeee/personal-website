    <h1>Fake News Detector:</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information. Fake news is untrue information presented as news. It frequently aims to make money through advertising or to harm someone's or an organization's reputation. The prevalence of fake news has grown along with social media. The identification of fake news is becoming more and more challenging because people with malicious purpose are generating fake news articles that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate news. Machine-driven identification of fake news is essential since people typically lack the time to check references and ensure that reports are authentic. What we have done is a simplistic approach that looks at the news headlines and tries to predict whether they may be fake or not. Fake news can be intimidating as they attract more audience than normal.
    </p>
    <h2> Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      A major challenge in fake news detection is to detect it in the early phase. Another challenge in fake news detection is the unavailability or the shortage of labelled data for training the detection models. We propose a novel fake news detection framework that can address these challenges. Our proposed framework exploits the information from the news articles and the social contexts to detect fake news
    </p>
    <h2> Aim of the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of the project is to develop a fake news detector to avoid and detect the fake news spread on the internet.
    </p>
    <h2>Domain of the project</h2>
    <p>
      The domain of the project is Machine Learning. Machine learning uses
 various algorithms based on the requirement of the project.

    </p>
    <h2> Scope of the project</h2>
    <p>

      The scope of this project determines whether the news being circulated is real or fake. It ought to make it easier for readers to understand the news that is being reported.
    </p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The methodology carried out in this model is, firstly the news will be given as input and the fake news detection system will classify it is real or fake news. The fake news detection system is developed using machine learning algorithms. It involves data collection, pre-processing, splitting the data, building and training the model and testing the model. These are the steps involved to build the system.
    </p>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <p>
      ●	Accuracy rate is high
●	Easily detects fake news.

    </p>
    <h2>Feasiblity Study</h2>
    <p>
      A Feasibility study is carried out to check the viability of the project and to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed system. The application of fake news detection system must be evaluated. The feasibility study is carried out in three forms
•	Economic Feasibility
•	Technical Feasibility
•	Social Feasibility

    </p>
    <h2>
      Economic Study
    </h2>
    <p>
      The proposed system does not require any high-cost equipment. This project can be developed within the available software.
    </p>
    <h2>Social Feasibility:</h2>
    <p>
      feasibility is a determination of whether project will be acceptable or not Social. Our project is Eco-friendly for society and there are no social issues. our project must not be threatened by the system instead must accept it as a necessity. since our project is applicable for every individual in the society to take care about the society and environment. The level of the acceptance of System is very high and it depends on the methods deployed in the system. our system is highly familiar with the society.

    <p>
      The above figure represents the architecture diagram of this project. Firstly, the dataset is obtained and pre-processed. The data is pre-processed by removing all unnecessary special characters and fields. The data is then divided into training set and test set. The text data is converted into feature extracts by Tf-Idf vectorizer. The model is trained using the training set and the accuracy of the model, Logistic Regression is obtained. The input is given by the user from the test set and the news is classified as fake or real news.
